# json-schema

The universal-resume standard in json-schema format. Inspired by the [json-resume](https://github.com/jsonresume) organization adding required fields and a few other improvements.

See [schema.json](./schema.json)

Generated using this [builder](./build.ts) from the [ts-schema](https://github.com/universal-resume/ts-schema) repository, thanks to Effect `JSONSchema` module.
