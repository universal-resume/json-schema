## Introduction
**üßë‚Äçüéì What is JSON Schema?**  

JSON Schema is a vocabulary for annotating and validating JSON data. It defines the shape of JSON documents (types, required fields, structure, and constraints). When applied, a validator checks input JSON against the schema and reports whether it is valid or which rules it violates.  

A JSON Schema acts like a contract: applications built on top of it can reliably manipulate the same structure of data.  

üëâ In short: **JSON Schema = rules + validation for JSON data structure.**

This repository hosts the **[schema.json](./schema.json)** file defined by [universal-resume](https://github.com/universal-resume), designed to represent a professional resume.  

This schema is heavily inspired by the [JSON Resume](https://github.com/jsonresume) project. Check this [section]() to learn more about the differences.

## Integration
This [schema.json](./schema.json) is generated using a [builder](./build.ts), based on a source of truth written in TypeScript in the [ts-schema](https://github.com/universal-resume/ts-schema) repository (üôè thanks to the Effect `JSONSchema` module).  

This schema can be used with any JSON Schema validator.  
For integration in a TypeScript environment, you can install the `@universal-resume/ts-schema` package to benefit from the included types and validators.  
Support for other languages may come in the future.

## Contributing
‚ö†Ô∏è Please do not edit [schema.json](./schema.json) directly.  
The schema is generated from the [ts-schema](https://github.com/universal-resume/ts-schema) repository, which is the source of truth.  

Contributions (fixes, extensions, discussions, improvement request) should be made in the `ts-schema` repository.

## Differences with json-resume

This project is heavily inspired by [json-resume](https://github.com/jsonresume), which has been a reference for defining resumes as JSON for many years.  
However, we are diverging and maintaining a separate schema to address several limitations and to better support modern tooling.  

The main reasons for diverging include:  
- **Required fields** ‚Äî enforcing certain fields makes the schema stronger, improves type-safety, and unlocks more reliable tooling on top of it (date, name, title, headline, etc.).  
- **Additional properties** ‚Äî adding missing fields that are commonly needed in professional resumes (availability, references, remote, and many others)
- **Enums instead of free strings** ‚Äî replacing arbitrary strings with enums for fields like `type` or `fluency`, ensuring consistency and better validation.  
- **Reworked nomenclature** ‚Äî clearer, less ambuigous and more consistent naming conventions across the schema (work -> employment, project -> initiative, etc.).  
- **Native TypeScript integration** ‚Äî the schema is derived from [Effect](https://effect.website) `ts` definitions, allowing us to export types and validators directly (See [ts-schema](https://github.com/universal-resume/ts-schema)).  
- **Maintenance** ‚Äî several long-standing, unclosed issues in the json-resume repo blocked evolution; this project aims to move faster and stay actively maintained.  

üëâ In short: **universal-resume builds on json-resume‚Äôs ideas but focuses on stronger typing, modern tooling, and active maintenance.**
